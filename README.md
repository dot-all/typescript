# TypeScript
Welcome to the TypeScript Mini-Projects, Algorithms, and Challenges repository. Here you will find a variety of implementations designed to enhance your skills in TypeScript. Currently featured projects include:
- Luhn: Implementation of the Luhn algorithm, commonly used for credit card number validation.
- Bitwise: Examples and applications showcasing bitwise operations in TypeScript.
  - Decimal to Binary Conversion: Convert decimals to binary base 2.
  - Bit Manipulation: Convert decimals to base binary to bits and bitwise operators.
- Search: Examples and applications of search algorithms in TypeScript.
  - Linear search: The linear search algorithm traverses each element of a list one by one until it finds the desired element or reaches the end of the list.
  - Binary search: The binary search algorithm halves a sorted list repeatedly to find a target value.
  - Hash table: The hash table search algorithm uses a hash function to map keys to indices, allowing for fast retrieval of values.
  - BTree: The B-tree search algorithm navigates a balanced tree structure to efficiently locate keys, ensuring logarithmic time complexity for insertions, deletions, and searches.
  - Graph: Graph search algorithms explore nodes and edges to find paths or specific nodes, using techniques like BFS or DFS.
- Sort:
  - Bubble sort.
  - Selection sort.
  - Insertion sort.
  - Quick sort.
  - Merge sort.
